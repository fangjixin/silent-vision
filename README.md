# Silent Vision

Silent Vision recognizes a personalized catalog of fixed phrases from a short,
silent camera clip. It is not open-vocabulary lipreading and does not transcribe
arbitrary speech.

The browser records a 2-5 second WebM clip with audio disabled. CPU code decodes
the video, detects one face, aligns it, and extracts a 96 x 96 grayscale mouth
sequence. The official classifier then trains and runs in PyTorch on AMD Radeon
through ROCm. An accepted result gets its exact text and business intent from the
registered phrase catalog.

The final Radeon run, evaluation report, and recorded demonstration are still
pending. This repository does not publish an accuracy, latency, throughput, or
memory figure. A run built with `--allow-small-dataset` is non-evidentiary and
proves pipeline execution only.

Repository: <https://github.com/fangjixin/silent-vision>

## Current Catalog and Product Boundary

The fixed-phrase checkpoint schema has one learned class per enabled `phraseId`.
`UNKNOWN` is a rejection result, not a trained class. The initial catalog is:

| phraseId | Exact displayed text | Language | Mapped intent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `zh_light_on_hello` | `你好，请帮我打开灯` | `zh` | `LIGHT_ON` |
| `zh_chat_meal` | `你吃饭了吗？` | `zh` | `CHAT_OTHER` |

An accepted `LIGHT_ON` decision can cross the current agent boundary as
`action="execute"`; an accepted `CHAT_OTHER` decision becomes `action="ignore"`;
a rejected clip becomes `action="reject"`. This repository returns structured
decisions only. It does not control a light, door, camera recorder, or editing
application.

The same boundary can be integrated into a creator workflow as a deliberate,
hands-free command input, but that downstream integration is outside this
repository. Before connecting an executable intent to any device or production
tool, add an allowlist, confirmation policy, adapter, and failure handling.

## System Architecture

```text
Browser camera (audio: false)
  -> 2-5 second WebM over WebSocket
  -> PyAV decode and 25 FPS resampling on CPU
  -> MediaPipe single-face detection and landmarks on CPU
  -> alignment and 96 x 96 grayscale mouth crop on CPU
  -> fixed-phrase Torch model on AMD Radeon / ROCm
  -> probability + phrase-centroid distance acceptance
  -> exact phrase text and intent from the checkpoint catalog
  -> command.result
  -> agent.result (execute, ignore, or reject)
```

FastAPI creates a short-lived session at `POST /api/sessions` and accepts the
clip at `/ws/{sessionId}`. Health endpoints are available at `/health/live` and
`/health/ready`. WebSocket origins are restricted by `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

The Torch model downsamples each mouth frame to 16 x 16, combines appearance
with the signed adjacent-frame difference, projects the result to 64 features,
and applies two depthwise-separable temporal blocks. Attentive pooling feeds a
normalized embedding and a dynamic phrase head. The implementation enforces a
trainable-parameter cap below 150,000.

The checkpoint stores one calibrated minimum probability and a maximum cosine
distance for each phrase's training centroid. Both gates must pass. Top-1 margin
is reported only as a diagnostic; it is not an acceptance gate for the
fixed-phrase Torch model. Rejected output has intent `UNKNOWN`, contains no
matched phrase text, and cannot execute.

## Requirements

Use Python 3.11. Runtime dependencies and their exact version ranges are in
[`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt):

- FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, and pydantic-settings for the service;
- NumPy, OpenCV, PyAV, MediaPipe, and Pillow for CPU video preprocessing;
- orjson and python-multipart for API serialization and uploads.

[`requirements-dev.txt`](requirements-dev.txt) adds pytest, browser-test tools,
Ruff, ReportLab, pypdf, pdfplumber, and QR-code support. `package.json` records
the Playwright dependency.

PyTorch is intentionally not installed from `requirements.txt`. The AMD machine
must supply a PyTorch build compatible with its ROCm image. Training and the
production Torch backend fail closed unless `torch.version.hip` is non-empty,
`torch.cuda.is_available()` is true, and `cuda:0` is visible. PyTorch uses the
name `cuda:0` for its ROCm device namespace; this does not mean an NVIDIA runtime
is in use.

Local development setup:

```bash
cd /path/to/silent-vision
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
npm install
```

A current Chromium-based browser is recommended. Camera access requires a
secure context; `http://localhost` is allowed for local work, while a remote
browser should use HTTPS.

## 1. Record Phrase Samples

Prototype mode is an explicit recording and data-inspection mode. It is not the
official classifier demo. On the Radeon workspace, start it with:

```bash
cd /path/to/silent-vision
export PERSISTENCE_ROOT=/workspace/persistent/silent-vision
export COMMAND_BACKEND=prototype
export ALLOWED_ORIGINS='*'
bash scripts/amd_real_oneclick.sh
```

Open the emitted local or tunnel URL. In the Calibration panel, save independent
takes under `profileId=global` and enter the exact catalog phrase. Use the mapped
intent shown in the table above. Save unrelated clips with source intent
`UNKNOWN`; they are used only for rejection calibration and final evaluation.

The official dataset gate requires at least 15 independent takes per registered
phrase: 10 training, 2 threshold-calibration, and 3 final-evaluation clips. It
also requires at least 15 unrelated clips: 5 for calibration and 10 for final
evaluation. Duplicate sample IDs or duplicate mouth-array hashes are excluded.
Source recordings and metadata are never rewritten by the manifest builder.

Inspect the stored profile:

```bash
/opt/venv/bin/python scripts/inspect_prototypes.py \
  --root /workspace/persistent/silent-vision
```

## 2. Build Immutable Manifests

Build the five disjoint manifests and their inventory from the global profile:

```bash
/opt/venv/bin/python scripts/build_command_manifest.py \
  --profile-root /workspace/persistent/silent-vision/profiles \
  --catalog command/phrase_catalog.json \
  --output-dir /workspace/persistent/silent-vision/manifests \
  --seed 17
```

The command fails when the official sample minimums are not met. For a local or
Radeon execution smoke only, append `--allow-small-dataset`. The resulting
inventory records `evidentiary: false` and must not support performance claims.

The catalog owns the corrected phrase label and intent. The source intent is
retained in each manifest row as `source_intent`, so a mislabeled recording can
be audited without editing the source files.

## 3. Train and Calibrate on ROCm

Training uses only `train.jsonl` plus the two calibration partitions. It refuses
evaluation manifests and has no CPU classifier fallback.

```bash
mkdir -p /workspace/persistent/silent-vision/models \
  /workspace/persistent/silent-vision/reports

/opt/venv/bin/python scripts/train_command_classifier.py \
  --catalog command/phrase_catalog.json \
  --inventory /workspace/persistent/silent-vision/manifests/inventory.json \
  --train-manifest /workspace/persistent/silent-vision/manifests/train.jsonl \
  --calibration-known /workspace/persistent/silent-vision/manifests/calibration-known.jsonl \
  --calibration-unknown /workspace/persistent/silent-vision/manifests/calibration-unknown.jsonl \
  --output /workspace/persistent/silent-vision/models/fixed-phrase.pt \
  --run-summary /workspace/persistent/silent-vision/reports/training-run.json \
  --epochs 80 \
  --seed 17
```

For an inventory created with `--allow-small-dataset`, a shorter epoch count may
be used to check execution. That checkpoint and run summary remain
non-evidentiary.

## 4. Run the Frozen Final Evaluation

After training and calibration have frozen the checkpoint thresholds, evaluate
only the untouched final partitions:

```bash
/opt/venv/bin/python scripts/validate_command_classifier.py \
  --checkpoint /workspace/persistent/silent-vision/models/fixed-phrase.pt \
  --known-manifest /workspace/persistent/silent-vision/manifests/evaluation-known.jsonl \
  --unknown-manifest /workspace/persistent/silent-vision/manifests/evaluation-unknown.jsonl \
  --output /workspace/persistent/silent-vision/reports/final-evaluation.json
```

The JSON report records counts and denominators for phrase accuracy,
mapped-intent accuracy, known acceptance, accepted-phrase accuracy, and unknown
false acceptance/rejection. It also records the effective threshold source,
checkpoint hash, manifest hashes, backend, and device. Do not tune thresholds on
these final partitions.

Run one checkpoint-backed mouth-ROI clip with:

```bash
/opt/venv/bin/python scripts/infer_command_clip.py \
  --checkpoint /workspace/persistent/silent-vision/models/fixed-phrase.pt \
  --mouth-roi /absolute/path/to/mouth_roi.npy
```

## 5. Start the Official Radeon Demo

The official launchers default to the Torch backend and stop before startup when
the ROCm device or phrase checkpoint is unavailable:

```bash
cd /path/to/silent-vision
export PERSISTENCE_ROOT=/workspace/persistent/silent-vision
export COMMAND_BACKEND=torch
export COMMAND_CLASSIFIER_CHECKPOINT=/workspace/persistent/silent-vision/models/fixed-phrase.pt
export ALLOWED_ORIGINS='*'
bash scripts/amd_real_oneclick.sh
```

In a second Radeon terminal, expose port 8000 if the event image provides
`rc-tunnel`:

```bash
$HOME/.local/bin/rc-tunnel expose --port 8000
```

Restrict `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to the final public origin when practical. The
application itself does not provide authentication or TLS termination.

For a checkpoint-backed ROCm smoke, provide one real mouth-ROI sample:

```bash
export COMMAND_CLASSIFIER_CHECKPOINT=/workspace/persistent/silent-vision/models/fixed-phrase.pt
export COMMAND_SMOKE_SAMPLE=/absolute/path/to/mouth_roi.npy
bash scripts/smoke_rocm.sh
```

This smoke proves that the guarded Torch path executes on `cuda:0`; it does not
replace the untouched final-evaluation report.

## Other Development Modes

Fake mode is for deterministic API and browser-flow tests only:

```bash
export COMMAND_BACKEND=fake
export ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8000
.venv/bin/uvicorn backend.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Prototype mode compares saved examples and supports collection/debugging. It is
not a fallback in the official Torch startup and is not Radeon classifier
evidence.

## Privacy and Limitations

- Browser capture requests video only; this application sets `audio: false`.
- Normal command clips are processed from memory and a temporary decode file.
- Prototype recording mode persists the original video and derived arrays. The
  repository has no consent or retention UI; operators must define a policy.
- Recognition is personalized and closed-set. Camera angle, lighting,
  occlusion, speaking style, and sample quality can change results.
- Probability and centroid-distance rejection is a calibrated heuristic, not a
  guarantee that every unrelated phrase will be rejected.
- The current source returns structured decisions only and contains no physical
  device or creator-tool integration.
- No performance figure is published until the official final-evaluation report
  exists.
