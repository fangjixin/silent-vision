# Silent Vision - Track 1 Submission Index

Applicant: Jixin Fang

Pull request title: `Track 1, Jixin Fang, Silent Vision`

Source repository: <https://github.com/fangjixin/silent-vision>

Silent Vision is a personalized fixed-phrase visual classifier with one
four-phrase bilingual catalog: Chinese `你好，请帮我打开灯` and `你吃饭了吗？`, plus
English `Hello, please turn on the light.` and `Have you eaten?`. The user
selects the language before recording; the application does not infer language
from the clip. Its ROCm-only Torch classifier uses a selected-language softmax,
then returns exact catalog text and a mapped intent only when the probability and
phrase-centroid distance gates pass. Otherwise it returns heuristic `UNKNOWN`.
It is not open-vocabulary lipreading.

The source, catalog, documentation, and generated assets are present. The
official bilingual Radeon run and frozen final evaluation completed on
2026-08-06 with evidentiary lineage verified. The untouched final partitions
produced 12/12 phrase top-1 accuracy, 5/12 known acceptance, and 9/10 unrelated
rejection. These are personalized, same-speaker fixed-phrase results. The demo
video is included with contest PR #293.

Recordings, checkpoints, and private reports are intentionally excluded from the
public contest bundle.
